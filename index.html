		<h2>Who are we?</h2>   
	    	<p>Basketball for Africa is an association created in 2015 in Paris. Its founder, Vincent Graillat, is a graduate of HEC Paris, who has always been passionate about basketball. After having worked for five years in several African countries, he decided to put his passion at the service of this continent, whose problems he had learned to understand.</p>

		<h2>What are our goals</h2>
		<p>Our association was created to participate in the development of the African continent through basketball. We aim to spread the practice of basketball on the continent, as we know that it is a sport that deserves to be known, while investing in several projects aimed at lifting entire populations out of poverty.</p>

	<div class="container">
		<h2>What are our actions?</h2>
		<p>In concrete terms, the first part of our actions consists of building basketball courts in many towns and cities, and providing access to sports facilities, especially for young people. We also organise events around basketball, sometimes with the participation of international basketball stars. In parallel, we finance economic projects that we carefully select and that we believe will benefit the greatest number of people.</p>

	<h2>Who do we work with? </h2>
	<p>We work in partnership with the NBA, FIBA and many international federations. We also work with players, notably Joel Embiid, who sponsored the construction of our first three centres in Abidjan, Yaounde and Bamako</p>
